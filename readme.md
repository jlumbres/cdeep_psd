# CDEEP Power Spectrum Density Analysis

Repository for all the CDEEP optical surface processing and analysis:
- Surfaces are post-processed to remove Zernikes (up to astigmatism) and cropped to clear aperture
- PSDs are calculated for each surface

The code in this repository requires downloading and installing modular code I've written called model-kit. You can find it here: https://github.com/jlumbres/model_kit

All data are uploaded onto Box.
